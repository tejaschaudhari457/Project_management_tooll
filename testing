## **2. Types of Software Testing**
### **A. Manual Testing**
Performed by testers without automation, includes:
- **Exploratory Testing** – Ad hoc testing to identify unexpected defects
- **Usability Testing** – Evaluates user experience and accessibility
- **Ad-Hoc Testing** – Unstructured and informal testing

### **B. Automated Testing**
Utilizes scripts and tools for efficiency:
- **Unit Testing** – Tests individual components (JUnit, NUnit, pytest)
- **Integration Testing** – Ensures proper interaction between modules (Selenium, TestNG)
- **Functional Testing** – Validates software functions (Postman, SoapUI)
- **Regression Testing** – Ensures new changes don’t break existing functionality

### **C. Performance Testing**
Evaluates system behavior under load:
- **Load Testing** – Checks system behavior under expected load (JMeter, LoadRunner)
- **Stress Testing** – Determines breaking point of software
- **Scalability Testing** – Measures system growth capabilities

### **D. Security Testing**
Assesses software vulnerabilities:
- **Penetration Testing** – Simulates cyberattacks (Burp Suite, Metasploit)
- **Vulnerability Scanning** – Detects security flaws (Nessus)
- **Ethical Hacking** – Identifies potential threats

### **E. Other Testing Types**
- **Alpha & Beta Testing** – Pre-release testing by internal/external users
- **Compatibility Testing** – Ensures software runs on different platforms
- **Mobile Testing** – Evaluates mobile applications (Appium, Espresso)
- **Database Testing** – Verifies data integrity (SQL queries, DBUnit)
